IAM
Identity and Access Management.
It’s a global service
A root account i created by default by you can create Users
You can have groups
Users and Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
Least priveleges is a good principle in AWS to give someone the minimum amount of pirvelges they should have

You’re given a root account but it’s best practice not to use that, want to create admin accounts

IAM is a Global service (dont need to select region)

With Group policies, they apply to every user in that group. If one person has only one policy, it can bea ttached with an inline policy

Can be overlaps of groups

The IAM policy structure is JSON
In a policy statement, it contains the 
“Sid” - identifier of the statement
Effect - Allow or deny access
Principal - account/user/group it applies to (can also apply to root users)
Action - list of actions this policy applied
Resource - list of resources this policy applied (Typically a s3 bucket)

Removing a user from a group removes their permissions that they had
Can add IAMReadOnly so that user can read IAM policy
On IAM dashboard -> Permission policies it shows the way they are attached (Directly, group etc)
Clicking on JSON shows the JSON form of the policy
You Can create your own policy and use visual editor or JSON editor
You can make a password policy(through account settings) and add requirements for a password
You can add Multi-Factor Authentication
With a physical device like Google Authentication, Authy, YubiKey, Hardware Keyfob
