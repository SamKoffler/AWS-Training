IAM
Identity and Access Management.
It’s a global service
A root account i created by default by you can create Users
You can have groups
Users and Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
Least privileges is a good principle in AWS to give someone the minimum amount of pirvelges they should have

You’re given a root account but it’s best practice not to use that, want to create admin accounts

IAM is a Global service (dont need to select region)

With Group policies, they apply to every user in that group. If one person has only one policy, it can bea ttached with an inline policy

Can be overlaps of groups

The IAM policy structure is JSON
In a policy statement, it contains the 
“Sid” - identifier of the statement
Effect - Allow or deny access
Principal - account/user/group it applies to (can also apply to root users)
Action - list of actions this policy applied
Resource - list of resources this policy applied (Typically a s3 bucket)

Removing a user from a group removes their permissions that they had
Can add IAMReadOnly so that user can read IAM policy
On IAM dashboard -> Permission policies it shows the way they are attached (Directly, group etc)
Clicking on JSON shows the JSON form of the policy
You Can create your own policy and use visual editor or JSON editor
You can make a password policy(through account settings) and add requirements for a password
You can add Multi-Factor Authentication
With a physical device like Google Authentication, Authy, YubiKey, Hardware Keyfob

Access Keys
Users are able to access AWS through:
AWS management console
AWS Command line interface (CLI) which uses access keys
AWS SDK which uses access keys

With the CLI, you can interact with AWS commands in yout terminal

AWS SDK lets your manage your APIs and embeds your application

When you remove a user from a group, they’ll lose their permissions so they when you do “aws iam list-users” they wont show up

AWS Cloudshell
Only available in some regions
It’s a terminal in AWS Management Console you can use and do commands as normal
Can do aws commands and it’ll show region you;re in, security credentials etc

IAM Roles
You can assign roles to AWS services
In an EC2 Instance you can make an IAM role.
It can access information, as long as it has the right permission
You creat your own role by going to IAM->Role-Aws Service->Search EC2->Use Case EC2
Can add IAMReadOnly for example

IAM Security
You can make an IAM security report that shows all users and their permissions
Can make list of all services and when each was accessed
Good to verify least privileges

On Left hand side “Credentials Report" -> Download credentials report
Can see passwords changed info, access keys, account info
Can look at Access analyzer too to see if user has correct permissions

IAM Best practices
Don't use root account except AWS setup
You want to make users and groups and strong password policy
Never shared IAM user and access keys
Audit permissions of your account with access advisor
