Elastic Beanstalk
Like Heroku (a PaaS), not as popular anymore
Can deploy dockerized containers
Lot fo legacy componenta


Types of Web environments:
Load-Balanced- Env:
Used ASG (auto-Sacaling Group) set to scale
Designed to scale

Single-Instance Env:
No ELB tp save on cost
Still uses ASG 
Public IP address needs to be used to route traffic to server


EB deployment methods
• Rollign deployment policy requires an ELB

All at once deployment policy is fasterst but most dangerous. Server needs to go down to do it

Rolling deploys batch of instances at a time. Takes batch’s instances out of service, then reattcaches updated services.

Rolling with additional batch - ensures that our capacity is never reduced

Immutable 
Create a new ESG group with EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud) instances
Deploy new updated version of a[[ on the new ec2 instances

EB performs in-place updates


Blue/Green deployment: when you run two identical production environments

Databases can be added inside or outside EB environment
